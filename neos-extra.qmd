# Results when optimizing a neural network observable and binning simultaneously {#sec-bins-app}
## 5-bin observable

### Metrics {-}

![Plots of the different metrics calculated on the test set for different training strategies using a 5-bin neural network observable. The results are averaged across 9 random seeds for the weight initializations. The scatter points on some of the curves represent the model that we would select in practice if using that training strategy (provided we decide to use the loss as the selection metric).](images/test_metricsfewbins)

### Histograms {-}
